## Context

I actually really felt the need to make a personal website for a long time, but I always held it off. I think that's because I had this kind-of-desire to make a perfect and pretty website on the first try, but not only did I face many roadblocks with learning frameworks that would allow me to do so, the mental barrier was insurmountable at times. 

Eventually, I decided "fuck all" and just made a straight static HTML and CSS website, just so I have something up runninng. It's probably too early to say, but having a website kind of forces me to update often and self-reflect, and I could see it as a motivator for some programs I'm writing right now.

Anyways, the main point of this post is not to drabble on and on about my reasons for making the website. In the process of making this website, I got the idea from a friend to use pandoc to convert Markdown to HTML, which saves the hassle of having to write a HTML file for every page.
