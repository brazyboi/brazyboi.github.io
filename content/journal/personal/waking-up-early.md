# Waking up early

So I've started waking up rather early, at around 7 to 7:30 AM. Considering the earliest of my classes on MWF is at 9:00 AM, there really isn't an obvious reason to wake up this early, especially since I'm not a morning person at all. But I do have this knack for being able to pop right out of bed as soon my alarm sounds, and I imagine myself looking pretty silly while springing up from the mattress. 

Either way, I feel like I need some peace before going to class, perhaps to get all of my lazy and sleepy vibe outta me, if that makes sense. If it weren't obvious enough, waking up 10 minutes before a class isn't really enough time to mentally prepare yourself, much less physically pack all your shit. Though my classes are a cakewalk right now (they just have a crap ton of homework load for absolutely no reason), I feel as if keeping up this habit is somehow beneficial to my productivity. I'm not one to really point my fingers at a specific cause for this, nor do I know if this is correlation or coincidence, but I'll trust my gut feeling with this one. After all, it's gotten me to write this at 1 AM in the fucking morning.

## It's probably good for you

I read somewhere (or I saw on Instagram Reels, who knows) that staying in your bed after you've woken up doesn't really help with sleepiness. And I can kinda see why! I kinda just feel more groggy if I laze around in bed for too long instead of just getting up immediately. However, now that I think about it, the "springing" out of bed is probably bad for my back (source: Instagram). Should probably stop doing that.

The peace I get from the extra time for my morning "routine" feels pretty great. I'm sure I can find some other words to describe it like "serene" but that doesn't really suit my taste. I'm kinda just babbling at this point. I take a walk to the dining hall right after to avoid the rush, but instead of zoning out like before, I'm reading some tech blog or some form of news, just to warm up my brain. It doesn't really have anything to do with my classes, I'm just looking for whatever seems kinda interesting and is upvoted quite a bit. I'm hoping that warming up the brain is like doing a little bit of dynamic stretching before lifting; it just unlocks the potential a bit. Although the brain isn't a muscle. But you know what they say, "train your brain like a muscle!" or whatever. 

## Blessed with time

I'm really feeling the "cherish your time" shit now. I think it's because of the internship application process, and I feel the need to work. That and how I realize how hard everyone else is working, so I gotta put in that effort. But enough of the generic sappy shit.

As a freshman at UCI, it's already been a month though it feels like I've barely done anything here. I mean, I've basically memorized where all my classes are, even if they don't happen every day, but that's not really anything meaningful. What I really hope I can do eventually is get closer with my professors and TAs, but the classes right now are just so damn boring and full of busy work that I can't find it in myself to actually interact with them after class or get out of my room to go to office hours. I'm sure that if I try, though, I'll get there eventually.

On the more positive side, I feel really blessed with time. It's only been around a week since I told myself to "lock in" (my way of motivation/discipline I guess), and I feel like I've achieved a good bit. If I keep this up, who knows what I could do in a year's time.

Waking up early really does give me more time in the day. Literally, sure, but the focused energy is what I really need throughout the day, giving me more *effective* hours.
