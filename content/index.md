# Lucas Zhong

Hello! I'm Lucas, and this is my website. I'm a student at UC Irvine studying computer science and pure mathematics. Some of my interests, in no particular order, are:

- Game development
    - Godot Engine
    - Gameplay/visual development
    - Shaders/technical art
    - Production
    - Gaming: currently playing PEAK, Valorant, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and Hollow Knight Silksong.
- Computer stuff
    - Full-stack web development
    - Python
    - Applications of AI/ML
    - Linux
    - UI/UX design
- Music production
    - Particularly EDM or hyperpop slop
    - Game OSTs
    - Listening to: Porter Robinson, indie rock, and hyperpop

## Purpose of this website
I started this website to track my development journeys and to document anything I've learned. I also want to improve at writing. Some goals I have are:
- Learn Rust / some systems programming language
- Musically produce full songs more frequently, even if they're all mediocre
- Get deeper into math

So yeah! That's mostly what I'll be posting about.
