# Lucas Zhong's Page

Hello, I'm Lucas Zhong, a first-year computer science major at UCI, starting from Fall '23. For now, I'll be hosting this on GitHub pages, though I hope to get a RPI or OPI to host this server on. I'll be detailing my struggles with balancing college and life.

## A new beginning, I guess

Some of my interests include:

- Gamedev
- Linux
- Programming little apps (though I need to get back into it)
- Exercising
- Valorant + eSports

I really should get to work, huh. Some of the things on my to-do list:

- Webdev
- Audio engineering/Coding plugins
- Spanish/Japanese
- Linear Algebra

I hope I'll be able to do it all.
