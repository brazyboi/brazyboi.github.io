Notes:
- Waking up early
    - Really helped
    - creating a schedule for eating
        - finally getting to bulk
    - staying disciplined/gym

- doing icebreakers
    - jsa did them really well
    - center them around interests
    - create competition

- feeling disconnected 
    - or this is just me being socially awkward
    - I read somewhere that they got their true friend group 7 months in, so that gives me hope

- Reading CS

I think I'll use this to type out what I think about things. Probably going to try to translate to Spanish and Japanese to challenge myself.
