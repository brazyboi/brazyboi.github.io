            <p>Hello! I’m Lucas, and this is my website. I’m a student
            at UC Irvine studying computer science and pure mathematics.
            Some of my interests, in no particular order, are: - Game
            development - Godot Engine - Gameplay/visual development -
            Shaders/technical art - Production - Gaming: currently
            playing PEAK, Valorant, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and Hollow
            Knight Silksong. - Computer stuff - Full-stack web
            development - Python - Applications of AI/ML - Linux - UI/UX
            design - Music production - Particularly EDM or hyperpop
            slop - Game OSTs - Listening to: Porter Robinson, indie
            rock, and hyperpop</p>
            <h2 id="purpose-of-this-website">Purpose of this
            website</h2>
            <p>I started this website to track my development journeys
            and to document anything I’ve learned. I also want to
            improve at writing. Some goals I have are: - Learn Rust /
            some systems programming language - Musically produce full
            songs more frequently, even if they’re all mediocre - Get
            deeper into math</p>
            <p>So yeah! That’s mostly what I’ll be posting about.</p>
